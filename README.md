# ✍️ Kotlin Handwriting Digit Recognition

An Android app built with Kotlin + TensorFlow Lite to classify handwritten digits drawn by the user on a canvas, using an embedded MNIST-trained model. The app supports drawing digits on the screen and gives a fast, offline prediction of what number was drawn. A great and visually impressive AI demonstration to showcase modern on-device ML. 🚀

## ✨ Project Highlights

- TensorFlow Lite on-device inference  
- Kotlin + Jetpack Compose for modern Android architecture  
- Drawing canvas for free-form digit input  
- Uses pre-trained MNIST model  
- Real-time prediction  
- Smooth and user-friendly UI
